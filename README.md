Random Task App is front-end application with no connected back-end. It allows your to Create, Delete and Randomise tasks. It's purprose was to refamiliarise myself with many of the old methods of app development in React, as well as gain an understanding how they have changed, with the addition of many of the new methods. 

Here are some of the API's Packages I used:
- React Bootstrap 
- Formik and Yup (Form creation and validation)
- React Hooks
- React Router
